			<h1>About Me</h1>
			<p>Hello, I'm Mitchell Wampler<br>
			I have a variety of details I would like to share with you so you can get to know me a little better:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>I am 23 years old. I was born in Bloomington, IN on August 21, 1995 but I am living in Carmel, IN.
				Before college, I went to Stinesville Elementary school in Stinesville, IN and I attended both junior high and high school at Edgewood in Ellettsville, IN. I've been local to Bloomington my whole life.</li>
				<li>I am the youngest of four siblings. The oldest is ten years older than me.</li>
				<li>I am a graduate from Indiana University Bloomington. I graduated in May of 2018 with a Bachelor's degree in Informatics. My cognate is Media and my minor is Human-Centered Computing. 
				During my freshman year of college, I atteneded Ivy Tech Community College to get my general education courses out of the way before transferring to IU.</li>
				<li>I recently got married to my girlfriend of 7 years. We have been together since my sophomore year of high school and have been together ever since. We got married June 2, 2018 and enjoyed a 7 day cruise through the Carribean for our honeymoon.</li>
				<li>I am currently taking a JavaScript course at Eleven Fifty. My front-end development knowledge made me curious to how back-end development works, so now I am training to become a full stack developer.</li>
