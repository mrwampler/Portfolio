			<h3>Tennis</h3>
			<p>My main interest and priorities has been revolving around <strong>tennis</strong> for the past ten years. Ever since I was in junor high, I picked up an interest for <strong>tennis</strong>. I have never loved a sport or hobby more than I do <strong>tennis</strong>. <strong>Tennis</strong> has become such a strong passion of mine to where I sleep, eat, and breathe it. It is the only sport I play, watch, and follow. I have learned a lot from it over the years and picked up some traits that I can use in my personal life. My life would definitely be different without <strong>tennis.</strong></p>

			<h3>Video Games</h3>
			<p>Ever since I was a kid, I enjoyed video games. My siblings and cousins would always play them so it didn;t take much for me to get dran in. I have always been a <strong>Nintendo</strong> fan. My very first console was a <strong>Nintendo 64</strong>. My siblings and I would play it everyday and have a blast. <strong>Mario</strong> games have always been my favorite series. To this day, I am still a huge <strong>Nintendo</strong> fan and I have owned every consoole that has been released after the <strong>Nintendo 64</strong> including portable devices.</p>

			<h3>Friends</h3>
			<p>Another one of my favorite hobbies that is necessary to me is hanging out with my <strong>fiance</strong> and <strong>friends</strong>. Without them, I would be insane. Everybody needs some <strong>love</strong> and <strong>support</strong> in their lives and that's exactly what I get with my <strong>friends</strong>. We always have a great time when we are together. We always enjoy grabbing a bite to eat at our favorite restaurants. Some of our favorite hobbies include bowling and laser tag. I met all of my close <strong>friends</strong> from high school and we are still pretty close to this day.</p>
